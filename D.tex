  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 00:22 by \textbf{whatever} (Chinh Luu and Matthew Tran)
    \item We can reduce the problem to the following: given a list $a$ and a list $l$,
      match each element of $l$ to an element of $a$ that is less than or equal to it.
    \item \textbf{Observation:} it is never worse to assign an element of $l$ closest
      element of $a$ less than or equal to it that we have not already assigned, so we
      can just sort both lists and try this assignment.
