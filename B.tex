  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 00:07 by \textbf{i\_am\_a\_business\_major} (Logan Baker)
    \item \textbf{Insight}: any value in between the first and the last value in the array does not contribute to the sturdiness factor at all.\\
    $\frac{a_2}{a_1} \times \frac{a_3}{a_2} \times \frac{a_4}{a_3} \times \cdots \times \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}} \times \frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} = \frac{a_n}{a_1}$
    \item If we choose the maximum radius as $a_n$ and the minimum radius as $a_1$, the sturdiness factor will be maximized.
    \item \textbf{Potential pitfall}: The answer has to be precise to $10^{-6}$. Your answer could be considered wrong if you don't print enough decimal digits. For example: $2.62$ is interpreted as $2.6200000$ while the correct answer can be $2.6200011$.
