  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 00:05 by \textbf{whatever} (Chinn Luu and Matthew Tran)
    \item Line up your family in non-decreasing order
    \item \textbf{Insight}: You can only control the orderings of the family members of equal height
    \item If there are $k$ people with height $h$, then there are $k!$ ways to order people of that height
    \item Multiply $k!$ together for each height and you will have the solution
    \item \textbf{Potential pitfall}: You have to take your solution mod 998244353 at intermediate steps as well
    \item Otherwise, your solution will TLE (if Python) or overflow (if C++/Java)
    \item Total complexity: $O(n)$ using hashmaps
  \end{itemize}
