  \begin{itemize}
    \item Nobody really attempted this one
    \item Find out whether there exist four lines that contain every point. Let's view this in a different way
    \item We assume the points were placed on one of four different lines and try to find these lines (if we can't, then we say they don't exist)
    \item We are tempted to use brute-force, but this is too slow
    \item \textbf{Insight} \begin{itemize}
      \item Suppose we have found $k+1$ points that are all collinear (check collinearity using cross product)
      \item Then, if there are $k$ lines we can draw that intersect all the points, one will be that line
      \item If we can't find those $k+1$ points and $n > k^2$ the problem is impossible
      \item If we can find the $k+1$ points, we remove all the points on the line we found, and recurse with $k = k-1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item If $n \le k^2$, since that is only 16, we can do a brute force and it will be fast enough
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insight}: If we pick two points at random, there is a pretty high ($\ge \frac{1}{4}$) chance they will lie on the same line
    \item Then, if we remove all the points on that line and pick two more, there is $\ge \frac{1}{3}$ chance they will lie on another line
    \item Then, if we remove all the points on \textit{that} line and pick two more, there is $\ge \frac{1}{2}$ chance they will lie on another line
    \item Worst case scenario, if a solution exists, there is a $\frac{1}{24}$ chance we find it. Solution is verified in $O(n)$ time
    \item We can run at least 1,000 tests during the time limit of 10 seconds, using C++ (more like 5,000 but let's be conservative)
    \item Chance of finding a solution, if it exists, is $(\frac{23}{24})^{1000} \approx 3 \times 10^{-19}$
    \item Therefore, our solution is basically guaranteed to work (have you ever been 99.99999999999999997\% sure about \textit{anything}?)
