  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 01:01 by \textbf{ti123} (Hang Li)
    \item The event space consists of every possible combination of trucks starting. There are $2^n$, since each truck either starts or doesn't
    \item Notice that $n \le 10$, so we can use brute force
    \item You can use recursion, but an easier way is to recognize that each bitmask of length $n$
      corresponds to a unique event, where person $i$ has a good truck day if bit $i$ is set
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item So let's loop over all bitmasks of length $n$, and for each, we can calculate the probability of this event as \[ \left( \prod_{\text{bit $i$ is 1}} p[i] \right) \left( \prod_{\text{bit $i$ is 0}} (1-p[i]) \right). \]
    \item Once we have the probability, we determine what place we would get if this event occurs, and add this probability to the output for that place
    \item Bonus: can you solve it in $O(n^2)$?
  \end{itemize}
