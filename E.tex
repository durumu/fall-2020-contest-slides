  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 01:11 by \textbf{tbolton2000} (Trever Bolton)
    \item Given lists $a$, $b$, and $c$ (each of length $n$)
    \item Every iteration, we do $a[i] -= c[i]$ for all $i$, and we want to know how many elements in $a$
      are less then the corresponding element in $b$ after $k$ iterations
    \item There may be lots of iterations, and it will be too slow to do each subtraction one
      iteration at a time.
    \item Observation: instead of recomputing the answer every time, we can first precompute how long each
      neighborhood in $a$ will take to pass the corresponding temperature in $b$
    \item If we sort this array, we can binary search for the time we are looking for and then just see
      what index we end up at -- this is our answer!
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Observation: instead of recomputing the answer every time, we can first precompute how long each
      neighborhood in $a$ will take to pass the corresponding temperature in $b$
    \item Let's create a new array $d[i] = (a[i] - c[i]) / b[i]$, then $d[i]$ is the time in
      milliseconds that it will take for the $i$-th neighborhood to begin working (in math, in code
      we might want to take the ceiling of this)
    \item If we sort $d$, we can binary search that array for the answer.
