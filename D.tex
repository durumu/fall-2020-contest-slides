  \frametitle{Problem D: Fence Posts}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item First solve at 00:22 by \textbf{whatever} (Chinh Luu and Matthew Tran)
    \item Formally, we want a sequence such that the longest increasing subsequence is of length $a$, but the greedy algorithm described gives an increasing subsequence of length $b$
    \item You may observe that the greedy algorithm always takes the first fence post. Let's exploit this.
    \item It turns out that we can come up with a sequence of length $a+1$ which works on general. Given $a$ and $b$: $a-b+2$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $\dots$, $a$.
    \item For example, if $a=10$, $b=5$, we get $7$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, $10$.
    \item \textbf{Potential pitfall:} there are many constructions, but if yours uses more than 150 numbers you will get WA
